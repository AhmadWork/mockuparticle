Because i have learn html little bit before most of the things in this part i already knew it but what i can tell is that i hoped that i have start learning html here first the way udacity teach is simply amazing and what i like most is how you encourage student to search instead of feeding them every small detail and yes i have used one the problem solving strategies from the first project which is searching for answers via google.
